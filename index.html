    <h4>What is Git and why is it so important?</h4>
    <h5>Git is a version control system that allows collaboration between developers.</h5>
    <h4>What's a branch and why do we create them?</h4>
    <h5>A branch is a divergence from the main line of development so you can continue to do work without messing up the main line. We creat them using the command $ git checkout -b BRANCHNAME</h5>
    <h4>What's the working tree?</h4>
    <h5>The working tree is the folder where the repo is initialised.</h5>
    <h4>What's the staging area?</h4>
    <h5>The staging area is the area that holds all the files we're ready to commit and push to the repository.</h5>
    <h4>What's the command to retrieve the latest version of your files from the remote server?</h4>
    <h5>$ git pull REMOTENAME REMOTEBRANCH</h5>
